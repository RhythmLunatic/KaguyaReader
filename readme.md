# かぐやReader/Kaguya-Reader

work in progress UWP manga/comic reader. Intended for your legally owned library of CBZ/CBR files.

It's named kaguya reader because it's mainly for manga. No, I don't think it's a good name. I'll probably change it later.

## Features
- It doesn't work
- Free and open source, unlike the competition!
- Tablet UI

## Planned Featues
- NFO support for local manga information
- Cloud drive browsing (OneDrive, Google Drive, HTTP, FTP, etc)
- MangaDex and possibly other browser support. I don't think UWP has plugin support however.
- Downloading manga from a non-local catalog
- The majority of features Tachiyomi already has
